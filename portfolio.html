				<h2>Portfolio of Work</h2>
				<p>
					Making a portfolio has been a very difficult task for me for a couple of reasons:<br>Firstly, I have programmed in a lot of different areas and in different development environments which all lend themselves differently to be hosted in a web page portfolio format.<br>Secondly, the Summer of 2019 I left my very cozy position of running the App Development Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) Program at the Halton DIstrict School Board. <br>
          I left suddenly when the Board refused to give me a leave of absence to help get the Six Nations Polytechnic's STEAM Academy get off the ground.<br>
          Leaving so suddenly left me in a position of not being able to collect some of my most polished work which remained on my school computer as I would have liked. Even worse, the process to transfer my Google Drive terminated mid-process leaving me with scattered remnants of empty and incomplete folders everywhere. <br>There is probably a lesson about why a cloud-based IDE is inherently better than device-based ones. <br> Long story short: Some projects I will just talk about, others I will refer to by image or screen shot.  Others I will refer by REPL.
