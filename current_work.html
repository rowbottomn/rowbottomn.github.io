				<h2>Current Work</h2>
				  <p>I am constantly looking for the next thing to use teach to my students.  I often find myself looking down blind alleys but the adventures are often noteworthy.<br>
          Here is some of the things I have most recently made followed some long range projects I am working on.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Corona Virus Public Service Announcement
              <p>The Corona Public Service Announcement is an example.  I was actually looking for a way for language learners at home to learn how to pronounce things properly even if they cannot see them face to face.  They can see an audio visualizer respond to the speech then try to make the visualizer respond in a similar manner.  One FFT on the audio track later, I felt like I had made something that seemed similar to a corona virus.  I thought how funny would it be to have an actual corona virus sing the song "Sorry" by Justin Bieber and then made this.  I do recognize this is in bad taste but its the first thing I made purely in THREE.js so I want to show it off to someone.  I also allow users to play different sound files in case they are not a fan of the 'Biebs'.</p>

             <li>VR Physics Simulations 
               <p>How do you do physics labs for online classes?  I have been looking at developing VR physics experiences in Replit.com for my students.  There is one which graphs the displacement time graph and you can use the 'w' and 's' to add accelerations.  From this graph and a spreadsheet, the other motion graphs are made.</p>

             </li>
          
          <h2>Current Notable Projects</h2>
          
            <li>VR Longhouse Experience
              <p>This is a collaboration with the Indigenous Knowledge Center.  Using a grant of $75,000 from the Ministry of Education, I will be building a template in Replit.com where VR experiences can be created for a variety of virtual field trip experiences.  What makes the VR field trips so different is that the student/user can activiely chose the media they want to play through activating "points of interest".  Part of the development cycle will be creating a template which is easy enough for teachers to make their own VR field trips.  And of course, I will be training the trainers in all of Six Nations Polytechnic departments.</p>
              <p>Another interesting use of the template will be a star map of the constellations for use with an EthnoAstronomy Course where looking at a constellation in the VR will play an indigenous story associated with that constellation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>OhnegiÃÅyo 
              <p>A water sampling project with collaboration from IBM, Rogers Cable, the University of Waterloo's Water Institute, the Six Nations Band Council, Mohawk College.  Basically this is a multiyear IoT project with STEAM Academy interns being paid by IBM to develop the sensors and networks to gather real-time water quality data along the traditional lands of the Six Nations / Hodinoso:ni people.  I have high hope on this project as their is not an indigenous community in Canada that does not suffer from water quality issues.</li>
            <li>Fingershaker Iphone App : A traditional Haudinosaunee game.
              <p>This is a tradiational Hodinoso:ni game of chance which was played on sections of bone antler or peach pits.  I made this as an iOS app in Swift to work on multiplayer networking in the iOS ecosystem.  I may return to it and publish when I am confident that it is not seen as culturally sensitive.</p>
