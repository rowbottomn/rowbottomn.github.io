				<h2>About Nathan Personally</h2>
				<p>
					Nathan Rowbottom has acquired a variety of interests and off-beat pursuits over the years including: fossils, sustainable
					development, physics and computer programming. He grew up in Brantford, and although he left to pursue higher education,
					he has always lived on the Haldimand Tract and near the Grand River. Putting aside past pursuits such as Rugby, raising
					Tilapia and Cosmology, Nathan currently spends about 30% learning new technologies, 30% teaching, 20% having adventures
					with his kids, and 20% futilely trying to improve on Overwatch.

          <h2>About Nathan Professionally</h2>
          <p>
            Nathan Rowbottom recently left his position of 13 years with the Halton School Board to join the STEAM Academy at Six Nations Polytechnic. Nathan made the change to fulfil a lifelong dream of empowering youth to make contributions to Haudinosaunee culture and language using the latest tool technology has to offer. His current projects are both ambitious and numerous as he struggles to find the right place to put his focus on.
