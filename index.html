				<h2>Nathan Rowbottom : TLDB <br>(Too Long Didn't Browse)</h2>
        
				<p>
					I am an incessant learner.  I love to come up with new ideas and possibilities. I am currently learning / teaching WebVR, AWS Virtual Machines, ML models for agent training and sensor monitoring, and how to make effective apps for learning indigenous languages.
				</p>
        <p>
          As an educator, I am a big believer in the intrinsic motivation that comes from the creative process.  I feel that the role of a 21st Century Teacher is to come up with 'ungooglable' problems and to mentor students on how to solve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always sought out a role in teaching other teachers and trying to challenge the educational paradigm.  I have always played a role in helping other teachers to learn new skills and transform their practices.  I am currently most interested in introducing new ways to encourage students to reflect on their learning, thus completing the medicine wheel of Teaching: modelling, assessment, feedback and reflection.
